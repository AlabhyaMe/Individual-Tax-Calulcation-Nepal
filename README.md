# Individual-Tax-Calulcation-Nepal
This Shiny app is designed to calculate the monthly tax liability for individuals in Nepal based on their salary. It addresses the common practice in companies of averaging annual tax deductions, by providing a detailed monthly breakdown of the actual tax payable. This feature allows individuals to better understand and manage their monthly financial commitments related to tax payments. The app is user-friendly and can be accessed online, making it a valuable tool for both employees and account departments. For those interested in its development, the app functions through two primary R scripts, ensuring accurate and efficient tax calculations.

This Shiny app provides a detailed view of the monthly tax payable by individuals in Nepal based on their salary. While company accounting departments typically calculate and deduct taxes based on an annual average, this app gives a month-by-month breakdown of the actual taxable amount, offering a clear picture of financial obligations throughout the year.

To access and use the app, please visit the following link: [Individual Tax Nepal Calculator](https://mealabhya.shinyapps.io/IndividualTaxNepal_Cal/).

For developers or users interested in the backend functionality, the app is driven by two main R scripts: `ShinyApp.R`, which contains all the user interface code, and `Function_server.R`, which houses the core programming logic. Both files need to be stored in the same directory for the app to function correctly. While `Function_server.R` does not need to be run independently, it is essential for the app's operation as it provides the necessary functions for tax calculations.

Cheers!
