# Individual-Tax-Calulcation-Nepal

This shiny apps shows the amount of tax payable by an individual in monthly basis in Nepal, on their salary. While a company's account department may average out the tax for a year before deduction, the table output in this app shows the real taxable amount each month.

To use the app, visit https://mealabhya.shinyapps.io/IndividualTaxNepal_Cal/.

The file ShinyApp.R has all the required code. It calls Function_server.R inside the program. It is important that both the files are placed in the same directory. You don't need to run Function_server, however, the major code is in this file.

Cheers!
